# Basic-Network-Sniffer
Project 1
I have created a Basic Network Sniffer Project using the Python Programming Language. This Project captures all the Packets around the Network Traffic and analyzes them .We can also Analyze the Packets based on the Various Protocol Types.
# Secure Coding Review
Project 2
I have created a tool will analyze the script and highlight potential vulnerabilities with recommendations!
This project helped me understand secure coding practices, static code analysis, and Python security risksâ€”which are crucial in the field of cybersecurity.
